Pseudocode of BFS
==================



Input -> Connected Graph and a "source"
Output -> Traverse all nodes and print the traversal order

BFS (graph, source):

-Initiate an array called "visited" and an empty queue "q"          [O(1)]
- mark visited[source] = 1 and q.push(source)                       [O(1)]
-while the queue is not empty:
  -head = q.front()         [O(1)]    v                                     
  - q.pop() -               [O(1)]    v 
  -print the node "head"
  -l adjacent nodes of for al"head":   o(E) 
    -if visited [adj_node] == 0:
      -visited [adj_node] = 1 and q.push(adj_node)


      total time complexity of this code is v+e;
